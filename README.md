A toy self mutating piece of code that recieves polymorphic shellcode remotely.

Self-Mod-2
A toy self mutating piece of code that creates its own mutated source code locally.

c2_server.py
Self-Mod-1's c2 server it reaches out to for shellcode.

# Why You Should Care

According to the 2018 Webroot threat report, polymorphic techniques was utilized in 94% of malware. Understanding how polymorphic malware works and how it is developed is important for you as a cyber security professional, to aid in detection and to allow you to undestand why detection in general of polymorphic malware can be complicated. For offensive security, understanding development techniques can aid in new methodologies of attack to better perform your job and give new perspectives on offensive security tactics.

# Three main ideas:

1. Polymorphic malware constantly changes its static signatures, new detection techniques are required.
2. Reverse engineering polymorphic malware is difficult, techniques to hide code make it difficult to spot polymorphic and self modifying behavior.
3. Polymorphic shellcode can be transmitted remotely with ease, making detection over the network troublesome. 

# The Future

New techniques to detect polymorphic malware are needed, it is not going away anytime soon. Current techniques are weak and require the malware to already be executing for detection to occur, rather than preventing infection in the first place.
